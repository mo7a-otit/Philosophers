# Philosophers

The philosophers project is aimed at providing a practical understanding of threading a process. Through this project, you will learn how to create and manage threads while exploring the concept of mutexes to ensure proper synchronization and avoid conflicts in concurrent programming.

## Project Description

The main objectives of the philosophers project include:
- Implementing a solution to the dining philosophers problem, which involves simulating a scenario where multiple philosophers sit around a table and eat from shared resources (forks).
- Creating and managing threads to represent the philosophers and their actions.
- Understanding the importance of synchronization and preventing issues such as deadlock and resource contention using mutexes.
- Exploring different strategies for handling resource allocation and concurrency in a multi-threaded environment.
